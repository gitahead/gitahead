Build Environment
-----------------

* C++11 compiler
  * Windows - MSVC >= 2017 recommended
  * Linux - GCC >= 6.2 recommended
  * macOS - Xcode >= 10.1 recommended
* CMake >= 3.3.1
* Ninja (optional)

Dependencies
------------

External dependencies can be satisfied by system libraries or installed
separately. Included dependencies are submodules of this repository. Some
submodules are optional or may also be satisfied by system libraries.

**External Dependencies**

* Qt (required >= 5.9)

**Included Dependencies**

* libgit2 (required)
* cmark (required)
* git (only needed for the credential helpers)
* libssh2 (needed by `libgit2` for SSH support)
* openssl (needed by `libssh2` and `libgit2` on some platforms)

Note that building `OpenSSL` on Windows requires `Perl` and `NASM`.

How to Build
------------

**Initialize Submodules**

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

**Build OpenSSL**

    # Start from root of gitahead repo.
    cd dep/openssl/openssl

Win:

    perl Configure VC-WIN64A
    nmake

Mac:

    ./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc no-shared
    make

Linux:

    ./config -fPIC
    make

**Configure Build**

    # Start from root of gitahead repo.
    mkdir -p build/release
    cd build/release
    cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..

If you have Qt installed in a non-standard location, you may have to
specify the path to Qt by passing `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path-to-qt>`
where `<path-to-qt>` points to the Qt install directory that contains
`bin`, `lib`, etc.

**Build**

    ninja
