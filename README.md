Build Environment
-----------------

* C++11 compiler
  * Windows - MSVC >= 2017 recommended
  * Linux - GCC >= 6.2 recommended
  * macOS - Xcode >= 10.1 recommended
* CMake >= 3.3.1
* Ninja (optional)

Dependencies
------------

External dependencies can be satisfied by system libraries or installed
separately. Included dependencies are submodules of this repository. Some
submodules are optional or may also be satisfied by system libraries.

**External Dependencies**

* Qt (required >= 5.12)

**Included Dependencies**

* libgit2 (required)
* cmark (required)
* git (only needed for the credential helpers)
* libssh2 (needed by `libgit2` for SSH support)
* openssl (needed by `libssh2` and `libgit2` on some platforms)

Note that building `OpenSSL` on Windows requires `Perl` and `NASM`.

How to Build
------------

**Initialize Submodules**

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

**Build OpenSSL**

    # Start from root of gittyup repo.
    cd dep/openssl/openssl

Windows:

    perl Configure VC-WIN64A
    nmake

macOS (Intel):

    ./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc no-shared
    make
    
macOS (Apple Silicon)

    ./Configure darwin64-arm64-cc no-shared
    make
    
Linux:

    ./config -fPIC
    make

**Configure Build**

    # Start from root of gittyup repo.
    mkdir -p build/release
    cd build/release
    cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..

If you have Qt installed in a non-standard location, you may have to
specify the path to Qt by passing `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path-to-qt>`
where `<path-to-qt>` points to the Qt install directory that contains
`bin`, `lib`, etc.

**Build**

    ninja

How to Install
-----------------
### Linux

The easiest way to install Gittyup is by using [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.Murmele.Gittyup).

**Arch Linux**

Install the `gittyup` package from the Arch User Repository.

	git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/gittyup.git
	cd gittyup
	makepkg -si

Or use an AUR helper.
Install `gittyup-git` for the VCS build.

### Mac OS

**Homebrew**

Install the `gittyup` cask from [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/gittyup).

    brew install gittyup

### Flatpak from terminal

If you want a more pure console use, this script run flatpak version disowning the process and silence the output pushing it to /dev/null.
Just save the script somewhere in your path, for example `/usr/bin` (or `~/.local/bin` if you have exported it), give execution permissions `chmod +x`, and run `gittyup` from your terminal.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
DIR=$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")
function run_disown() {
    "$@" & disown
}
function run_disown_silence(){
    run_disown "$@" 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null
}
run_disown_silence flatpak run com.github.Murmele.Gittyup
```
