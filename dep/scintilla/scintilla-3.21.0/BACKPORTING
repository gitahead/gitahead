Overview
========

The LongTerm3 branch gets nearly all of its updates from default via
backporting. The process is simple:

  hg update LongTerm3
  hg graft -e [changeset]

This grafts (or cherry-picks) [changeset] from default into LongTerm3. The '-e'
option allows for editing the commit message. Backported commit messages usually
have the form:

  Backport: [original commit message]

  Backport of [revision]:[changeset].

Any backport-specific additions, modifications, or deletions from the original
changeset should be mentioned in the new message.

Note: the '-e' option also gives you a chance to compile and/or test any adverse
effects produced by the graft prior to commit. Any changes made to files before
committing will reflect in the final graft.

In order to back out of a graft:

  hg rollback
  hg revert --all [--no-backup]

This can only be done ONCE, and affects the most recent graft, so make sure you
test any questionable grafts first before attempting another one.

Testing Backports
=================

Backporting a change is one thing, but ensuring the backport was successful is
another. Currently, the measure of "success" is whether Scintilla compiles on
all platforms after a backported change. This process can be automated using hg
hooks and the "check.mak" makefile. By adding the following to .hg/hgrc:

  [hooks]
  pretxncommit.adddeps = test -z "`hg status | grep '^A' | grep '\.\(h\|cxx\)$'`" || make -f check.mak deps
  pretxncommit.compile = make -f check.mak

whenever a backported change is about to be committed, hg runs "check.mak",
which attempts to compile Scintilla on all platforms. If successful, the commit
is made. Otherwise, the commit fails and changes must be made before attempting
to commit again.

The file "check.mak" is designed to run on a Linux machine that has
cross-compilers for Win32 and Mac OSX. It does not necessarily produce any
binary builds of Scintilla that can be used -- it just ensures Scintilla can be
built without compile errors. How to obtain a set of cross-compilers is beyond
the scope of this document. At the time of writing, GCC 4.8 and 5.4 are used.

Not only does "check.mak" perform platform compile checks, but it also has rules
for manually running Scintilla's unit tests (which take too long to run
automatically as a pre-commit hook), creating a LongTerm3 release archive set,
and uploading documentation to the LongTerm3 website on SourceForge:

  make test
  make zip
  make upload

The last rule requires user credentials.

Backport Status
===============

This section mentions all upstream changesets that have either NOT been
backported, beginning at 6289:4c1084a571ff (Starting 3.x long term maintenance
branch), or have information worth noting.

6290:2378244bf3c7 Converted to Automatic Reference Counting.
6291:31466630bccc Using instancetype for constructors.
6292:7f58802368f4 Using modern Objective C literals and indexing.
6294:e1301b1d2321 Use property dot syntax.
6295:57988f82bf71 Indented consistently by using astyle.
  Cocoa platform only.
  None of these are backported since I am unsure if they are supported in C++11.
  Despite finding references to ARC and some Modern Objective-C dating back to
  2013ish, I also see that Clang 4.0 introduced support for some of this.
  However, Clang 4.0 was released in early 2017.

6304:b6cf154fe8d0 SciTE change log.
  Not backported, as this applies only to SciTE.

6309:2d4cb83e9297 Back down from gnu++17 to gnu++14 so can build with g++ on current Ubuntu.
  Not backported since only C++11 is supported.

6317:0f15d772bceb SciTE change log.
6319:a3b66b2525e7 SciTE change log.
  Not backported, as these apply only to SciTE.

6328:3c87cf6d2599 Update IDocument for version 4. Drop IDocumentWithLineEnd interface to just have IDocument but with all the methods from IDocumentWithLineEnd. This removes version checking (for now). Use dvRelease4 ID. Drop mask argument to StartStyling.
  Not backported since IDocument and ILexer interfaces should not change once
  published according to Neil. Since the only substantial change is changing the
  StartStyling() API, it does not seem worth creating a new IDocument4
  interface with an option mask argument. It would likely cause compiler issues
  too.

6329:6468941ee017 Updated documentation to match changes to IDocument and ILexer.
  Not backported since IDocument has not been changed.
  It may be worth committed a modification of the first diff though, if 3.8.0
  ends up using 64-bit types for Sci_Position and Sci_PositionU.

6330:59f341b22087 Deprecate single phase drawing.
6333:320418de6275 Clean whitespace.
  Not backported since the curses platform relies on single-phase drawing for
  now.

6345:faecbd0078e5 Merge Ilexer and ILexerWithSubStyles into ILexer4 to avoid need for version checking in 4.0. Use lvRelease4 ID.
  Partially backported with 6346:72bd27f81477 minus ILexer4, since the ILexer4
  interface being added cannot co-exist with the existing ILexer interface.
  (LexerModule.h uses a single typedef.)

6357:96232b746342 SciTE change log.
6361:69fddf8f8a15 SciTE changelog.
  Not backported, as these apply only to SciTE.

  backport.

6409:c6a13f6eac24 Disable the animated find indicator on macOS 10.13 where it fails.
6410:29e81816b889 Change log.
  Not backported, since macOS 10.13 was released late 2017 and
  NSAppKitVersionNumber10_12_2 is probably not defined on earlier macOSs. I
  cannot find a good way to #ifdef around it.

6411:96becb885ce4 Updates for 4.0.2.

  Not backported, since it is unknown whether or not this feature will have any
  C++14 or C++17 features in it.

6432:b25c127aa6c5 Ensure build allows C++17. ARC setting is matching same setting at different scope so no effect.
6433:231ac99e1fdc Allow C++17 in all build and project files.
6435:5dd1b26df75f Replace Sci::clamp with C++ standard std::clamp function. std::clamp is from C++17.
  Not backported, since only C++11 is supported.

  components.

6964:d7ec2cdbcd16 If decoding DBCS text fails, use the MacRoman encoding to ensure something is visible.
  Not backported, as it makes use of a previous changeset not backported and is
  not easy for me to support if I patched it.

  feature for non-static data members.

7319:6db11117d56f Use noexcept where allowed, not inherited from base class, and not a COM method.
7320:304d26d7137f Minor warnings fixed - uninitialized, nullptr, type agreement, avoid casts.
  Backported, but without the C++17 multi-byte helper functions from a previous
  changeset.

7322:b79d68be7e96 Credit for SciTE change.
  Not backported, since this is LongTerm3.

7325:6148329fb2f3 Implement WStringFromUTF8 to simplify code that creates wstring objects for regular expressions and calling the Win32 API.
  Backported, but replaced std::string_view usage with const char* and size_t
  components. Also used #ifdef instead of C++17 `if constexpr` at suggestion of
  Neil.

7326:2f9b5e1c97ae Use noexcept where sensible. Rename UTF8 string_view parameters for clarity.
  Backported, but without the variable renames, since they are not applicable.

7328:521b1e23bfe2 Fix warnings from MSVC Code Analysis.
  Backported, but without C++17 std::size and `SymbolValue() = default` instead
  of `SymbolValue() noexcept = default`, since the latter causes a compile
  error.

7329:2662ef098d93 Use generic versions of ceil, floor, round, lround, trunc from <cmath>.
  Backported, but without std::round and std::lround, since older Mac OSX SDKs

  Not backported, since a previous commit to use C++17's std::string_view was
  not backported.

7423:2e2cf21cee0b Bug [#2093]. Remove restrictions on IME input length.
  Not backported, since the lack of a previous backport still references

  Not backported, since this is LongTerm3.

7835:bebc5e0eb82a Bug [#2115]. Avoid Clang warnings with COM_DECLSPEC_NOTHROW from declaration.
  Not backported, as its changes are in RTL code, which was not backported.

7841:023ad180a294 Update comments.
  Backported, but noted use with GCC 4.8 and Clang 3.4.

7843:f5d966795469 Remove Clang option that is not needed with Clang 9.
  Not backported, as this option was added in 2018.

7854:ab518c9df18e Builds without GNU extensions so set to standard C++17.
  Backported, but with c++11, not c++17.

7858:f7e61139f379 gcc 9 has a new warning deprecated-copy which occurs many times in Qt headers.

7863:507307a6c315 Use safe mechanism for converting between function pointers and void*.
  Backported, but with the c++11 version of static_assert().

7868:3b33632cad16 Lexilla implemented as loadable lexer.

  am unsure what to do with.

7870:6ffcbd42288c Define ILexer5 with methods for retrieving name, ID, and property values.

7871:ff54e1fc74f3 Implement SCI_SETILEXER.
  Not backported, since it utilizes the new ILexer5 interface, which is not
  compatible with ILexerWithIdentity. Since Lexilla and external lexers only
  create ILexer5* instances, supporting this does not make sense.

8229:c88f8cdede65 Feature [feature-requests:1347]. Optimize large insertions
